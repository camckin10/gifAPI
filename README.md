GIPHY API-
A practice in pulling from API's (Application Program Interface). The website that I created listed a few of my favorite things on butttons. The user can click on the buttons, and a group of GIF's from the GIPHY API will appear. The user also has the option to add to the "Favorite Things" buttons, or continue to pull GIF's that are from my "Favorite Things" buttons. ''
